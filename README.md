# Cloud DB HealthWatch – Intelligent Monitoring & Self-Healing System 🚨🛠️

A cloud-native platform to monitor, analyze, and auto-heal critical database resources across **AWS** and **Oracle Cloud**. Designed to ensure **high availability**, **cost-efficiency**, and **performance optimization**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In a multi-cloud environment, ensuring database uptime and performance is challenging. Manual monitoring leads to delays, downtime, and increased costs. **HealthWatch** aims to fix this with smart automation.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🔄 **Self-Healing Triggers** for DB restarts, auto-scaling, or failovers.
- 📈 **Real-time Health Monitoring** for Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and Oracle DB.
- 🚨 **Threshold-Based Alerts** (CPU, storage, replication lag).
- 📊 **Historical Usage Trends** and analytics dashboard.
- 🔐 **Audit Logs** for performance, changes, and access.
